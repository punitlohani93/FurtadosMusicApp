# FurtadosMusicApp
Application to search for music teachers and register for classes

This is the starter code for HIGH Furtados mobile application. The code available here is minimal and devoid of the business logic and assets which have been implemented in the actual application. The app is a cross platform hybrid application which runs on both iOS and Android platforms. This app has been developed using React Native and the finished application (inclusive of the business logic and custom APIs) state is managed using Redux architecture. Furthermore Realm has been used as a database to store User values.

The finished app is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.furtados.highapp
